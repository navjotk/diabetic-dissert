Current model: extract hog features using skimage and feed into svm model using sklearn. optimize hyperparameters and kernel selection using optunity

Note: The version of optunity that this code assumes is not the one currently available from pip. It is the latest version from github (version numbering is not available to differentiate between these numbers). Plus some additional modifications have been made to this version.
